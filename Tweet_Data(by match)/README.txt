1)The folders contain Tweet Data as .csv files in the following format:
Tweet_ID ::: Date ::: Tweet_Text ::: Geo_Location

2)Tweets were collected matchwise for each round since round 5 as a fully functional Harvester was developed only then(based on studying results from the previous rounds).

3)The 'Stats' file for each round holds the Tweet statistics collected using preprocessing.

4)Folder Misc contains tweets which are scraped during non-match days.

5)Round 1-4 folder contains tweet data on only specific matches.

6)Tweet Data could not be collected in an organized way for older rounds due to the fact that Search API (or any api for that instance)doesn't facilitate going back in time,not more than a week.
